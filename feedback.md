Q1: 7/10 points
-1 CI for logistic was too narrow
-2 The 95% in 95% CIs isn't related to the numbers in the intervals.  It means that if the intervals do not overlap, there is a 95% probability that there is a true difference in performances (not caused by random chance)


Q2: 9/10 points
-1 the line chart should have labels on the x and y axes


Q3: 10/10 points


Q4: 6/10 points
-4 The accuracy should increase with the threshold, and the recall of 1 should be 0 after threshold 0.1.  Something must be off in the implementation
